This is the project that I had done in the 12th grade, for my degree, graduate of HighSchool, since motorcycles have been a big part of my life I decided to make my project 
about a database of a motorcycle circuit from which by using all the information (circuit name, riders, weather) I could highlight the things that I want. I made 
this project using Oracle Academy, in which I also have a degree because, in the 12th grade, I studied databases.
